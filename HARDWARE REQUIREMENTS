OKAY SO MANY PEOPLE ARE THINKING THAT WHAT HARDWARE DO YOU NEED TO GET STARTED IN HACKING

Truthfully speaking you dont need any super computer to get started or begin hacking 

Just a working computer or laptop will do ;-)

now lets move to some advanced hacking (which is pretty expensive)

    LAPTOP 
a laptop is necessary when you will have to travel for your pen-testing expediotions which is very common once you start a job 
as a pen-tester.So a laptop with a minimum of 500gb storage(ssd is highly recommended) and 8gb ram and a quad-core processor with 
a graphics card(optional) is preffered.

    DESKTOP(optional)
    
A desktop is needed to make a password cracking rig and performing resource heavy tasks.We all know that a desktop is more power
efficient than a laptop.So if you have the money then you can build a password cracking rig with one(or more) high end gpus a 
powerful quad/six/eight core cpu with high clockspeed maximum ram supported and other common things.

    RASPBERRY PI(optional)
    
A raspberry pi is an awesome thing(at least i feel that).It has got numerous uses.It is one of the best things you can use to start your journey in hacking.
For those of you who dont know what a PI BOARD is: it is actually a credit card sized COMPUTER(Single Board Computer).With the release of the 
raspberry pi 4 the scenario of sbc's has changed.The raspberry pi 4 (4gb version) is an awesome board to get started.
A raspberry pi can be used to set up an AP or a VPN serverand many more.Its a very good and cheap option to get started, Just Plug and Play.
there are various versions of the raspberry pi and you can choose the one that fits you the best.

    ARDUINO(optional)
    
Arduino is another popular tinker board but IT IS NOT A COMPUTER(SBC) remember that.You can program an arduino to perform a particular
task such as tracking or monitoring or else.

there is a lot of stuff you can feed on these two boards (pi and the arduino)

    NETWORK ADAPTER(necessary for wireless cracking)
    
 A network adapter is necessary when you are going to attack an wireless network.You will need two adapters in reality.
 One has to support monitor mode i.e it must be capable of capturing the wireless transsmissions and send it to the software 
 that needs it.I am providing a link from where you can choose the network adapter that best suits you
