here i am going to provide you with some useful ips that i have gathered from blogs of security experts and from other sources



1) if you really want to grow a career in cyber security then the PTES(search on the web for this) is an MUST-READ for you. 

2) While learning hacking your path would be divided in two phases
          first you will have to learn the basic and well known methods which might be too old and have been patched.But you cant neglect them since thay are the steps 
          towards your jorney forward.
          
          second is learning nifty tricks which would actually bring money and fortune to you.To learn these nifty tricks the DEFCON VIDEOS and BLOGS OF SOME
          EXPERT HACKERS are the best place.Never forget to checkout newsletters and remain updated with top notch technology, since technology is evolving 
          everyday and it is very much possible that you will miss out some critical issues.I have also mentioned some free news letters in the repository
          which might be useful to you.
          
3) Try to develop your social engineering skills since thay are very much essential in almost every step of your pen-test.

4) Keep record of CVE's and other critical security breaches.

5) Keep an eye on pastebin type sites and github repos for password leaks and wordlists which you can feed during a bruteforce attack.
