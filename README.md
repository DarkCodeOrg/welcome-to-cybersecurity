welcome-to-cybersecurity

This is an guide for people aspiring to enter the world of cybersecurity

#so lets get into the topic without further ado;

I am sharing the experience that i have gathered till now. There is no reason to think this is the only way to get started.


        And there are numerous pre requisites to start hacking.But truthfully speaking you dont need any of them to get started,..just play ctfs and checkout some wargames and keep learning.

    First of all you will require a strong understanding of the linux operating system. 

    Why this is recommended is because using linux will give you strong understanding of your system and what happens under the hood of your operating system. Now if you avoid the linux terminal and stick to gui you will probably not learn much from there.You have to be a tinkerer, the golden rule or the thumb rule is TINKER==>BREAK==>TROUBLESHOOT/FIX==>LEARN.This is how you will get a grip of your system. Now many of you must have heard about kali linux (if not then no problem). It is a linux distro developed by Offensive Security.It is regarded as one of the most famous hacking distros(and it is).But learning linux from kali then you would probably be in a problem.It is not regarded as a beginner friendly distro, and moreover it does not include general purpose software that a user needs daily, it is packed up with hundreds of pen-testing tools. So if you are new to linux then i would personally recommend you to get started with a more friendly linux distro like ubuntu or linux mint, etc.

    to know more about linux and get started checkout my other post regarding linux 

    Secondly learn some networking 

    Again networking is an important part of cybersecurity.The OSI model, firewall, VPN, ssh and others are some common names that might frequently spring up.

    "you can skip networking in the beginning and learn the things as they come up gradually"

    Third is programming 

    Yeah now many people have confusions Do they need to learn programming ? Where from they should start programming? What languages should they learn? to answer these, um programming is going to comeup sooner or later in hacking. So programming would really be a useful skill not just in cybersec but even in other domains.So consider learning a programming language like python which has extensive usage in hacking and also is very easy to get started with.. just find out free tutorials on the internet at sites like w3schools.com, geeksforgeeks.org, etc....or checkout some free tutorials on youtube.

    Fourth and the most important one...

    The most important thing is patience... you would not become an expert in this field overnight.You would have to be patient throughout the journey because there would be times when you might feel disappointed and think that you have learnt nothing, but believe me it happens to everyone out there, just keep calm and look up solutions on the internet.

     

     
    note :  
     hacking is misrepresented in hollywood movies... so dont think that what you would be doing is sitting in front of a black screen and green letters flowing everywhere on your screen... for most of the part.. hacking is basically coding and finding errors and bugs in a program or a network and then exploiting them and that might sound boring but it actually becomes fun slowly....and forget about hijacking your friends social media account its just another myth...you wont be doing any such things ...nobody does ðŸ˜†



    But Where or better How should i get started....

    glad that you asked.......

    The best place to get started would be in my opinion OverTheWire.org ...its a great site with wargames ranging from beginner to advanced level. The bandit wargame is all about learning linux and it is a great place to start so just head towards the site ..but before you go... i would recommend you to atleast get a bit familiar with the linux OS ( checkout this ).Then you can smoothly carry on your journey. 

Afterthat you can have a look at Ctftime.org there you would find all upcoming ctf events (capture the flag events are hacking challenges that take place online).

all other resources such as books,tutorials,cheatsheets will be there on the reository soon.
And it is my kind request to all the readers that please do contribute the resources which you think might be useful for beginners.                                      


thanking you,,
