# welcome-to-cybersecurity
this is an guide for people aspiring to enter the world of cybersecurity

so guys if you are visiting this page it means that you highly aspire to become an hacker or penetration tester 

so let me introduce myself :  I am a hardcore linux user and computer geek.I am also a beginner in this field and an aspiring hacker

now you might be thinking why should i (as a beginner) write a guide for this topic?
the answer is simple becase many of the people face a common problem that from where should they begin learning, what are the pre-requisites and also there is a lack of proper resources. Even i faced problems(and even facing now also).

so i am writing this guide so that we(me and all of you reading this) can build up a all in one place here, so that the aspiring hackers and white-hats dont get depriciated from the very beggining 


#so lets get get into the topic without further ado;

I am sharing the experience that i have gathered till now.
There is no reason to think this is the only way to get started.

I am just trying to give newbies a view of this field.I will try to provide you with all the resources that i have gathered 

okay so please forgive me if i behave rudely sometimes ! and also my english !

First of all i would like to tell you that hacking is something that you would probably not like to keep as a hobby since it demands for extreme hardwork and labour, so if you are a lazy person then you must stay away from this field.
 
 And there are numerous pre requisutes to start hacking 
 
1) First of all you will require a strong understanding of the linux operating system
          Why this is recommended is because using linux will give you strong understanding of your system and what     happens under the hood of your operating system. Now if you avoid the linux terminal and stick to gui you will probably not learn much from there.You have to be a tinkerer, the golden rule or the thumb rule is TINKER==>BREAK==>TROUBLESHOOT/FIX==>LEARN.This is how you will get a grip of your system.
          Now many of you must have heard about kali linux (if not then no problem). It is a linux distro developed by Offensive Security.It is regarded as one of the most famous hacking distros(and it is).But let me tell you that if you start learning linux from kali then you would probably be in a problem.It is not regarded as a begginer friendly distro, and over that it does not include the software a general user needs daily, it is packed up with hundreds of pen-testing tools.
          So if you are new to linux then i would personnaly recommend you to get started with a more frindly linux distro like ubuntu or linux mint, etc.After having an solid understanding of the linux OS, i would suggest you to take a free(if not paid) linux SysAdmin course.Now you must be wondering why do you need this,you want to become a pen-tester not a companys sysadmin!But let me tell you that a sysadmin course will surely give you a broad understanding of the OS and also managing various services and networks which is a "you-must-know" requirement for hacking.Since unless you know how the system is managed or controlled you can't break into the system.
          
               
2) Secondly you should know networking.Again networking is an imporatant part of your career.You just cant skip anything from these topics that are mentioned here.The OSI model,cloud storage, firewall, VPN and other things are an inevitable part of your career in cybersecurity.

3) Third : programming.Yeah now many people have confusions Do they need to learn programming ?Where from they should start programming?What languages should they learn?
   to answer these, um programming is a must thing for anybody who wants to grow his/her career in IT.Most of the resources on the internet would tell people to start programming with python(which is an easy language) but if you look at the recommendations of people actually working in IT(developers,and other people), i cann guarantee you that would tell you to start programming with C,which makes a lot of sense since C can be regarded as the grandfather of all modern languages.And with C you can program anything and everything(the code might be big and the concept might be tricky but it is possible).So starting with C would again give a solid base for understanding of other languages.Now i would tell you something that might seem insane to some of you; actually you will need to know as many languages as you can, if not writing code in it then also you must know what would be the output of a code.
   Okay now where are your coding skills utilised ? if you are writing your own exploit or creating your own tool you will need it.Also if you are using someone elses exploits you must check out the source code and verify its consequences, because you would probably not want to hamper/if not destroy your or your customers data/the system.So before implementing someone elses code be sure to check its end results.After surfing the web and as much research as possible i have found the following languages to be mostly implemented in this field: 
          1) C and C++
          2) python(for writing short and handy exploits or even tools)
          3) ruby(a cross platform language that can be used for writing exploits)
          4) bash scripting/shell scripting(for writing shell codes)
          5) perl(for implementation on systems with less computing power)
          6) assembly(for reverse engineering hardware)
          7)javascript(for webpages and websites)
          8)sql(for querying databases)
    also remember that MORE NEVER HURTS...
    
4) Fourth: various security systems : If you want to break into  system you wil need to know how the system is secured what kind of security is implemented on the system.Try checking out various security systems like DEP, ASLR,IDS sensors,Juniper intrusion detection,Deny Hosts,Suricata,Snort etc

    



After having a good grip on all the above topics i hope one could start his/her path towards the huge world of cybersecurity.


all other resources such as books,tutorials,cheatsheets will be there on the reository soon.
And it is my kind request to all the readers that please do contribute the resources which you think might be useful for beginners.                                      


thanking you,,
