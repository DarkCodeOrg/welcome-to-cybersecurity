# welcome-to-cybersecurity
this is an guide for people aspiring to enter the world of cybersecurity

so guys if you are visiting this page it means that you highly aspire to become an hacker or penetration tester 

so let me introduce myself :  I am a hardcore linux user and computer geek.I am also a beginner in this field and an aspiring hacker

now you might be thinking why should i (as a beginner) write a guide for this topic?
the answer is simple becase many of the people face a common problem that from where should they begin learning, what are the pre-requisites and also there is a lack of proper resources. Even i faced problems(and even facing now also).

so i am writing this guide so that we(me and all of you reading this) can build up a all in one place here, so that the aspiring hackers and white-hats dont get depriciated from the very beggining 


#so lets get get into the topic without further ado;

I am sharing the experience that i have gathered till now.
There is no reason to think this is the only way to get started.

I am just trying to give newbies a view of this field.I will try to provide you with all the resources that i have gathered 

okay so please forgive me if i behave rudely sometimes ! and also my english !

First of all i would like to tell you that hacking is something that you would probably not like to keep as a hobby since it demands for extreme hardwork and labour, so if you are a lazy person then you must stay away from this field.
 
 And there are numerous pre requisutes to start hacking 
 
        >First of all you will require a strong understanding of the linux operating system
          Why this is recommended is because using linux will give you strong understanding of your system and what     happens under the hood of your operating system. Now if you avoid the linux terminal and stick to gui you will probably not learn much from there.You have to be a tinkerer, the golden rule or the thumb rule is TINKER==>BREAK==>TROUBLESHOOT/FIX==>LEARN.This is how you will get a grip of your system.
          Now many of you must have heard about kali linux (if not then no problem). It is a linux distro developed by Offensive Security.It is regarded as one of the most famous hacking distros(and it is).But let me tell you that if you start learning linux from kali then you would probably be in a problem.It is not regarded as a begginer friendly distro, and over that it does not include the software a general user needs daily, it is packed up with hundreds of pen-testing tools.
          So if you are new to linux then i would personnaly recommend you to get started with a more frindly linux distro like ubuntu or linux mint, etc.After having an solid understanding of the linux OS, i would suggest you to take a free(if not paid) linux SysAdmin course.Now you must be wondering why do you need this,you want to become a pen-tester not a companys sysadmin!But let me tell you that a sysadmin course will surely give you a broad understanding of the OS and also managing various services and networks which is a "you-must-know" requirement for hacking.Since unless you know how the system is managed or controlled you can't break into the system.
          
          
        >Secondly you should know networking
