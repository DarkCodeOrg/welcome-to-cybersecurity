This repository contains multuiple resources for beginners to get into ethical hacking

It is recommended to get started with CTFs , they are in my opinion the best way to atart hacking as they provide a very good platform to begin hacking without getting into the hassle of dealing with modern security implementations. They help cover the basics of it and develop upon it as one progresses.

Some populkar CTFs are: 

PicoCTF

tryhackme.com
